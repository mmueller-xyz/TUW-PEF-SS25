## Core Concepts

### Corporate vs. Project Financing
- **Corporate Financing**: Company-level financing covering multiple projects (portfolio approach).
- **Project Financing**: Single project financed through a Special-Purpose Vehicle (SPV), isolated financially and legally from sponsors.

### Financing Instruments
- Private/Public Equity Financing
- Bond Financing
- Credit Financing

## Cash Flows in Corporate Financing

The cash flow sequence involves:
1. Firm raising capital (debt/equity).
2. Investing in assets.
3. Generating cash from operations.
4. Paying taxes.
5. Distributing remaining cash (interest, dividends, debt repayments) or reinvesting it.

## New Project Evaluation

Evaluate a new project’s attractiveness by comparing:
- Return on existing assets vs. return on new project.
- Costs of financing via:
  - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
  - Cost of Equity
  - Cost of Debt

## Important Formulas

### Operating Cycle (OC)
Measures duration from purchase of inventory to receipt of payment from customers.

$$
\text{OC} = \text{InventoryDays} + \text{AccountsReceivable~Days}
$$

### Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
Time from cash outflow (inventory purchase) to cash inflow (sales receipt).

$$
\text{CCC} = \text{OperatingCycle} - \text{AccountsPayable~Days}
$$

## Debt and Equity as Contingent Claims

### Equity Payoff (Option Interpretation)
- If Firm Assets $>$ Debt:

$$
\text{EquityPayoff} = \text{FirmAssets} - \text{Debt}
$$

- If Firm Assets $<$ Debt:

$$
\text{Equity~Payoff} = 0
$$

- Equity can be viewed as a call option on the firm’s assets with the strike price equal to the debt.

### Debt Payoff (Option Interpretation)
Debt payoff can be interpreted in two ways:
- Firm Assets minus Equity Call Option:

$$
\text{DebtPayoff} = \text{FirmAssets} - \text{EquityCallOption}
$$

- Risk-free Bond minus Put Option:

$$
\text{DebtPayoff} = \text{Risk-freebond} - \text{Put Option on Firm Assets}
$$

- Equity holders hold a put option allowing transfer of downside risk to debt holders.

## Shareholder Value Maximization
- Primary corporate objective: Maximize shareholder value.
- Ensures efficient capital allocation without long-term harm to employees, lenders, customers, or society.
- Optimal if pursued as a long-term goal.

---

## Agency Problems and Solutions

### Problems
- Conflicts arising due to misalignment of interests between management (agents) and investors (principals).

### Potential Solutions
- Monitoring by the Board of Directors.
- Market for corporate control (e.g., takeovers).
- Information intermediaries (analysts, rating agencies).
- Incentive-aligned contracts (e.g., stock options), although these may encourage short-termism.

## Project Financing (via SPV)

### Key Features
- Independent financial and legal entity.
- Limited or no recourse to sponsors.
- Repayments primarily from project-generated cash flows.

### Advantages of Project Financing
- Reduces agency costs.
- Avoids debt overhang; does not affect sponsor credit rating directly.
- Improves risk management (due to higher leverage structure).

### Disadvantages of Project Financing
- Higher transaction costs (approximately 5-10% of total investment).
- Reasons: Extensive evaluations, contractual complexities, increased monitoring.
